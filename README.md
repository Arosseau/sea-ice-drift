### Sea ice drift - AI Brussels

Authors: Andries Rosseau & Elias Fern√°ndez

Code from the Climate Change hackathon challenge on sea ice drift.

The 'Velocity length prediction.ipynb' contains the code for creating and training the neural network that estimates the length of the ice drift vectors, the 'Wind-ice angle prediction.ipynb' contains the code for creating and training the neural network that estimates the angle between the wind velocity and the ice velocity.

All code should be fully workable in an environment like Google Colab, by importing Charles' original data files. This repo contains no actual predictions or data, in accordance with the Hackathon NDA.
